I’m a Computer Science student specializing in Cybersecurity. Although I’m still early in my IT journey, I’ve already built a solid technical foundation in Linux and Windows administration, Python, and Java. Before tech, I worked as a cashier and a receptionist—roles that sharpened my customer‑service mindset, attention to detail, and ability to stay calm under pressure. Those experiences taught me that clear communication and patience are just as important as maintaining security.
